My childhood experiences were solitary. Due to frequent moves, I seldom had the opportunity to form lasting connections. Philosophy provided me with a sense of community and solidarity, which has inspired my passion for education. In the following statement, I articulate my teaching philosophy, experiences, and future aspirations.

In my course work, I aim to cultivate a culture of scholarship. My research explores the relationship between moral knowledge and popular narratives, particularly those found within cultural artifacts. Drawing on Susan Ambrose's (2010) principle that prior knowledge shapes learning, I aim to connect students' sociological experiences with their existing knowledge in my teaching.

I often rely on prior learning. What I have found is that in doing so, my classrooms are able to address implicit assumptions many of us often hold. By utilizing course materials to prompt reflection on students' preconceptions, I demonstrate how philosophical issues intersect with their everyday experiences. I emphasize the importance of healthy communication and its role in fostering meaningful relationships, linking moral epistemology with holistic education.

I have found that effective teaching also requires strong motivation. To engage students in philosophical inquiry, I often begin with thought experiments.

* By inviting them to envision discussions on sensitive topics within a trusted circle, I highlight philosophy's capacity for virtuous reflection.
* I emphasize the process of thinking critically and sharing beliefs, rather than solely focusing on the content of philosophical views.

### Value and Expectations for Learning

I structure my teaching materials around the principle that for a concept to be truly memorable, it must hold intrinsic value for the student. This can manifest in at least two ways, such as moments in the course that spark personal reflection, or questions that students feel compelled to explore independently.

* I design assignments to prompt students to engage deeply with the material by encouraging them to develop their own inquiries.
* A primary expectation I have of my students is that they engage deeply and reflectively with the course material.
* One approach I have employed is to incorporate readings that implicitly convey philosophical arguments, such as analyzing popular films like "Cider House Rules," which subtly address ethical dilemmas.

I frequently assign readings that prompt reflection on self-identity and its significance in leading a fulfilling life.

* Research suggests that this approach not only enhances students' retention of information but also fosters active reading habits.
* Active reading involves
    * questioning the material,
    * seeking clarity,
    * summarizing key points, and
    * speculating on potential responses from the author.

By providing a supportive environment for students to engage in active learning,

* I can encourage them to question, discuss, and reflect on course material.
* This promotes a culture of scholarly inquiry, emphasizing the social aspect of learning and encouraging students to learn from each other.

The most important goal here is to enable them to see philosophical thinking as a lifelong pursuit. In my courses, I cultivate a safe environment where students can engage in active inquiry.

* I prioritize assessing students based on their depth of engagement with the material, emphasizing critical thinking and reflection.
* I encourage students to ask questions, fostering a collaborative learning community where we collectively explore challenging concepts.

Central to my teaching approach is Susan Ambrose's (2010) concept of active learning. I encourage students to take on both the roles of teacher and learner, fostering a dynamic exchange of ideas among peers and with me as the instructor. Approaching learning as a social endeavor enables the members of a classroom to create a culture of scholarship. My classroom approach seeks to involve everyone in the classroom to jointly work towards constructing innovative ideas through dialogue and exploration of class materials.

Learning extends beyond the classroom and is not merely a means to achieve good grades. Therefore, I aim to instill in my students a lifelong commitment to intellectual inquiry and critical thinking. By engaging in philosophical dialogue together, students develop the skills and mindset necessary for ongoing intellectual growth and engagement in scholarly discourse.

### Future Academic Aspirations

In 2022, I participated in Feminist X-Phi, a research collaboration at CUNY Graduate Center, where I explored experimental philosophy methods. I presented my own research and collaborated on empirical projects, enhancing my understanding of philosophical inquiry. I have developed material related to digital humanities research and applied this material to my courses. I look forward to developing more advanced versions of this material into a stand-alone course.

During my assistantship at the Walter J. Ong Center for the Digital Humanities, I developed an introduction to philosophy course integrating digital humanities techniques. I aim to expand this course by incorporating corpus analysis of popular cultural artifacts, aligning traditional philosophical views with textual analysis approaches.
