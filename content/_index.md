title: A Philosophy of Play
toc: false
---

Games are a kind of cultural artifact. Like other cultural artifacts, they make possible important and wide ranging questions. These include:

* Practical versus intrinsic benefits
* Acceptable sources and methods of children's education
* Questions about their ontological status
* Normative standards of play

Among these, I understand popular music as a kind of narrative, and moral knowledge as a way of defining behavior through identity. I am interested more broadly in artifacts of culture. Artifacts of culture I understand as sources of testimony which a culture uses to communicate various values to members on the inside and outside of that culture.

This blog is a collection of scholarly readings and their commentary, on the nature of mind and imagination central to aesthetic questions of play.
