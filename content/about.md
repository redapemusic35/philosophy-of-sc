I am currently finishing a dissertation on narratives and moral knowledge. In it, I understand popular music as a kind of narrative, and moral knowledge as a way of defining behavior through identity. But my interests vary beyond music. I am interested more broadly in artifacts of culture. Artifacts of culture I understand as sources of testimony which a culture uses to communicate various values to members on the inside and outside of that culture.

Games are a kind of artifact in this sense, at least they might be and that's what we are here to figure out. What better place to start than in the UAE universe, more specifically, the Stanton system.

“What is a game?” ([Nguyen, 2017, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/8SZFENUU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/YJDXNEB6?page=1&annotation=VDY68CDA))

I first heard about Star Citizen a number of years before the pandemic. I always thought that it was a cool concept and unlike any game I had heard of or played. I should inform the viewer however that I am not truly a gamer. What I mean by this statement, is that you, as my audience should take my claim: "unlike any game I have heard of or played" with a grain of salt. I do not have much experience. In fact, though other members of my family, namely from a previous generation (and namely exactly one) were quite early adopters of "gaming culture", my most immediate family members were quite sceptical of anything having to do with the nature of play and make-believe. Video games, comic books, Dungeons and dragons, etc.

Regardless of all that however, here we are.

Where are we you might ask? Let's start with some introductions. I am a PhD candidate in philosophy. I am currently finishing a dissertation on narratives and moral knowledge. In it, I understand popular music as a kind of narrative, and moral knowledge as a way of defining behavior through identity. But my interests vary beyond music. I am interested more broadly in artifacts of culture. Artifacts of culture I understand as sources of testimony which a culture uses to communicate various values to members on the inside and outside of that culture.

If you go to the course website, there you will see a list of readings and the schedule we will discuss them. It would be best if you read ahead, at least a couple of days. However don't read to far ahead as it becomes progressively easier to forget important details. Each week we will discuss one of the readings on the associated "course" website. These will be various readings on game theory, design, literary theory, cultural studies, etc, all having to do with video games. At least that is how we will apply these readings.

Star Citizen will be the context. I think that what would be most helpful is that if we use various examples from the SC universe. For instance, we might discuss a given concept covered in a particular reading. When covering Roger Caillois' four categories of play; *agon, mimesis, alea*, and *ilinx*. we can enact comptetive play, or make-believe, or gamble our fortunes away etc.

Therefore, some discussions could, at times, be live role playing exercises.
