> To summarize briefly, I shall describe the exploration of our problems in several fifth-century tragedies, which will insist on the irreducible role of luck in shaping human life and its value; then, Plato's beroic attempt, in middle-period dialogues, to save the lives of human beings by making them immune to luck; finally, Aritotle's return to many of the insights and vlaues of traggedy, as he articultates a conception of practical rational that will make human beings self-sufficient in an appropriately human way. {{< cite "nuss01g" >}}

What is the value of the poet?

What about tragedy in general?

Are its benefits practical? Prudential? Intrinsic or subjective?

Or are they moral?

This is an introductory philosophy course. Using stories, narratives, and hypotheticals, it offers a way to reflect on our moral judgments. By the end of the course, students will have had the opportunity to reflect on their moral judgments, intuitions and motivations.
