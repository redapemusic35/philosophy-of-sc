> To summarize briefly, I shall describe the exploration of our problems in several fifth-century tragedies, which will insist on the irreducible role of luck in shaping human life and its value; then, Plato's beroic attempt, in middle-period dialogues, to save the lives of human beings by making them immune to luck; finally, Aritotle's return to many of the insights and vlaues of traggedy, as he articultates a conception of practical rational that will make human beings self-sufficient in an appropriately human way.
