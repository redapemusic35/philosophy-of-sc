Games and music are kinds of cultural artifacts. Like other cultural artifacts, they make possible important and wide ranging questions. These include:

* Practical versus intrinsic benefits
* Acceptable sources and methods of children's education
* Questions about their ontological status
* Normative standards of play

Among these, I understand games, like popular music, as a kind of narrative, and moral knowledge as a way of defining behavior through identity. I am interested more broadly in artifacts of culture however and their uses as moral testimony. Artifacts of culture I understand as sources of testimony which a culture uses to communicate various values to members on the inside and outside of that culture.

In the following are various reflections on the question regarding play's ability to communicate and negotiate various values to the members of a culture.
