### Abstract

“The primary purpose of this article is to provide an overview of several different philosophical approaches to games, and hopefully demonstrate their relevance and value to one another.” ([Nguyen, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/8SZFENUU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/YJDXNEB6?page=2&annotation=LHJTUTPE))

- ontology: what is a game, what are we doing when playing them?

- value: what is the value of playing games


### Foundational work on Games

#### early work on games

- value in terms of practical benefits

- games as useful methods for children’s education

- outlets for agressive energies


#### current

##### huzingian

- magic circle of play

    - new roles and rules for behavior

    - no usual consequence outside the circle


##### caillois’

- 4 categories of play

    - agon, competition

    - mimesis, make-believe

    - alea, luck and gambling

    - ilinx, play of vertigo and disorientation

- game impulses

    - paida, impulse towards free exploration and discovery

    - ludus, gaming impulse, tendency towards regulation and measurement


#### Analytic Philosophy

##### suits’

- game == taking up unnecessary obstacles for the sake of the activity they make possible. Activity would be impossible without.

- inversion of means and ends

    - practical life: means important for valuable ends

    - game life: arbitrary ends are important for particular means

- games are the purpose of life

    - informal argument

        - utopia == no problems, therefore free time to play games

        - games sole activity in utopia

        - games are purpose of life

    - formal argument

        - practical activity seeks to eliminate itself

        - game play does not seek to eliminate itself

        - games are purpose of life


### Computer games as representations

- treating games as narrative, fiction or rhetoric


Janet Murray’s *Hamlet in the Holodeck*

- Tetris is commentary on fast-paced, desperate nature of industrialized, capitalist life


Espen Aarseth’s *Cybertext*

- Digital games are a new distinctive kind of text

    - ergodic literature, reader must expend nontrivial effort in traversing the text


### Ludology vs Narratology Debates

- Ludology,

    - story is chronology of events in a narrative, discourse is order events emerge in the telling of that narrative, so narrative (traditional) audience interprets events, representations that contain information (Frasca 1999)

    - but games, player configures events in pursuit of a goal, games are simulations, narrative --> fiction (Grant Tavinor 2009),

        - Walton’s thoery of fiction. All representative artworks are forms of make-believe play.

 be the sole activity.

    - therefore games are the purpose of life

- What is the purpose of activity?

    - to eliminate work

        - the purpose of medicine is to eliminate disease

        - in turn eliminates the purpose of medicine

    - art

        - soothes ailments of the heart

        - no ailments of the heart in utopia

    - Game play

        - does not seek to eliminate itself“Early academic attempts to cope with games tried to treat games as a subtype of narrative and to interpret games exactly as one might interpret a static, linear narrative.” ([Nguyen, 2017, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/8SZFENUU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/YJDXNEB6?page=1&annotation=GKQ8EVJV))

- games are interactive narrative, audience hears and interprets the story, player enacts and creates the story

- novel fiction using interactive techniques to achieve immersion in a fictional world

- new way to represent causal systems, criticize social and political entities

- questions about games as artworks, kinds of artworks

- or cooperative artworks

- what are the normative nature of games

### Ontology and Value

- what is a game, what are we doing when we play a game, what is the value of a game?

    - approaching them as texts means treating them as theoretical tools such as psychological study of narrative, or fiction, or rhetoric to understand the representational content of games

    - games can also be thought of as artworks, where we ask about the authorship and ontology of games

    - **philosophy of sport** motivates us to ask questions about the normative nature of games including concerns of fairness, rule-application, and competition

- One approach is to research work by literary theorists cultural studies, new media scholars, anthropologists, game designers, and some philosophers in the area of ‘game studies’.

## Early Research on Games

#### Philosophy of Play

Johan Huizinga’s *Homo Ludens*

- circle of play where rules of standard life, e.g., motives of productiveness, truth-seeking, and moral correctness, are suspended. In circle, there are no concerns of truth, falsity, good or evil, vice or virtue

- as such, concerns about standard practical benefits or educational goals, or concerns about excessive energy that we would normally have about life, are suspended,


**Instead:**

- games occur within a “magic circle” of play

    - inside are new roles and rules for behavior

    - has no consequence outside the circle

    - magic circle is similar to religious ritual and theater, we enter into consecrated, dedicated ground suspending everyday activities, take up new roles and motivations


Roger Caillois’ *Man, Play, and Games*

- offers four categories of play

    - agon: play of competitiion

    - mimesis: play of make-believe

    - alea: play of luck and gambling

    - ilinx: play of vertigo and disorientation

- paida vs ludus:

    - paida == childlike free exploration and discovery

    - ludus == tendency towards regulation and measurement, i.e., adults wrestling according to rules with a judged outcome

#### In Analytic Philosophy

Bernard Suit’s’ *The Grasshopper*

- Games are the purpose of life

- unnecessary obstacles make the activity of playing a game possible

    - in ordinary life, we select means for independently valuable ends

    - in game life, we select arbitrary ends of the sake of undergoing some particular means


**The Purpose of Life is Game**

- utopia

    - no problems, dearth of aim,

    - therefore game would
