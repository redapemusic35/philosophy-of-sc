# Christian Hip-Hop and Moral Priviledge

Narrative thinking is substantial in our lives as it provides ways of thinking about how our lives may have gone differently, our plans for the future, and how things might turn out (non-actual episodes).

Considering Christian Hip-Hop, I argue that such considerations are an important factor when determining ethical principles on which to develop artificially intelligent music curation services. This is because Christian Hip-Hop undermines the standard narrative commonly associated with lower socio-economic communities.

## Narrative Thinking, Planning, and Agency

When making plans, we are constrained by:

- contingent facts about ourselves

    - character traits

    - personality traits

    - emotional dispositions

    - abilities

- external circumstances

    - events

    - other people

        - their plans

        - policies

        - intentions

    - past experiences


Past experiences are connected to counterfactual thinking and regrets

## I. Non-Actual episodes and narrative thinking

A non-actual event is one that takes place in the past and in the future, in make-believe and other fictional events, counterfactual events, non-local events (not local to the agent).

> “A narrative is a kind of representation of a sequence of events.” ([GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/AYWTHX4T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/WU5FHVXP?page=2&annotation=HUL6LUMX))
>
> “It is more than just a bare collection, though; it reveals a certain coherence in what happened, configuring causal and other connections into a narratable episode or episodes.” ([GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/AYWTHX4T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/WU5FHVXP?page=2&annotation=FQ5CP77L))

This is because narrative is the mental representation of a sequence of events (a sequence of thoughts, thought through, conceived (neutral timeline, neutral whether conscious or subconscious)). It provides coherence of the causal and other connections between events into a narrative episode or episodes.

What we can glean from these episodes are coherence, meaningfulness, and emotional importance/import (emplotment, a psychological process which can be more or less successful) for those implicated in the narrative and those who engage with the narrative.

In other words, narratives give those who are implicated by them and those who engage with them, ways to consciously or subconsciously think about the events mentally represented by that narrative.

## II. Emotional Import

> “Where a narrative reveals the emotional import of what is narrated, it shows (or states, or otherwise discloses) that a certain kind of response is thought to be called for or to be appropriate.” ([GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/AYWTHX4T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/WU5FHVXP?page=2&annotation=7MZHJWEX))

This is not clear

1. Narratives first seem to outline the proper emotional response to a given event.

2. Yet they are also distinct from emotions that are an agent’s response to a given event or sequence of events.


> “The emotional import of a narrative is thus distinct from any emotion that might be felt in response: what happened was horrifying, and I, as “external narrator,” might or might not respond with horror to my horrifying narrative of what happened.8” ([GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/AYWTHX4T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/WU5FHVXP?page=2&annotation=QGTZY6AP))

The distinction then is between emotional import and emotional response

1. emotional import is integral part of the narrative

2. emotional response is a response to it


#### Internal and External Emotional Import

##### 1 First example, where they are the same

- I *in the narrative* who feels fear---I as the internal character---and I respond thus in the narrative because in the narrative I find the incident to be frightening to have this particular internal emotional import

- As an external narrator, I might also feel fear as a result of conceiving this frightening incident. Therefore this kind of response is external to the narrative.


The agent as character feels fear and the agent as audience also feels fear.

##### 2 Second example, where they differ

- The agent as character may be humiliated by a more senior member at work. In the moment, all they would feel is humiliation, embarrassment, and shame.

- However, taking an external perspective on what happened, “I might conceive of what happened as deserving anger and resentment”


By thinking though these narratives, we make the emotions appropriate in response to the narrative. For instance, dramatic irony, the narrator is not aware of crucial facts about what happened until later and as such, the external emotion, the one in response to the internal emotion is different from the internal one.

##### 3 third example, variances

- content of the thought-through narrative varies

- as does one’s grasp of what is happening in the actual world varies


Imagining a narrative scenario that explains current events for instance. You might be waiting at the train station for someone who should be there by an agreed upon time but who has not yet shown up. You imagine her getting hit by a bus, getting lost, or falling ill.

Each imagined scenario comes complete with its own set of emotions, frustration, fear, compassion, etc.

> “When you finally actually see her arriving, your perception of her is infused with the relief that you now feel in the knowledge that your worries are baseless, and with your awareness of the past narrated possibilities of how she might not have arrived on time, and with the envisaged narrated possibilities of happiness that the future promises.11” ([GOLDIE, 2009, p. 100](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/AYWTHX4T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/WU5FHVXP?page=4))

## Narrative Thinking and Planning

- Hypotheticals == imperatives about oughts in light of stated goals


> “Hypothetical imperatives are imperatives that tell you what you ought to do if you want to achieve some stated goal; as Kant puts it, they “declare a possible action to be practically necessary as a means to the attainment of something else that one wills (or that one may will).”13” ([GOLDIE, 2009, p. 100](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/AYWTHX4T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/WU5FHVXP?page=4&annotation=AXLC8C36))

- When you fall short of these goals, you experience negative emotions.

- the negative emotions motivate counterfactual thinking, thinking back to the crucial moment that contributed to your failure to realize your goals

- Regret is an external emotion that arises in response to your decision underlying your goal failure

- Each, negative emotions, counterfactual narrative thinking, and regrets can have a feedback effect on one’s grasp of the related hypothetical imperatives, helping one to learn from one’s mistakes.


Negative emotions then motivate counterfactual thinking.

# An ethical turn in ethnomusicology is synonymous with a cultural one

# Introduction

The authors propose challenging the existing assumptions underlying the ontology, epistemology, methodology, and axiologies important for the study of the ethics and cultural politics of music AI.

> “We propose that the time has arrived for MIR to reflect on its ethical and cultural turns (if they have been initiated at all) and take them a step further, with the goal of profoundly diversifying the discipline beyond the diversification of datasets. Such diversification, we argue, is likely to remain superficial if it is not accompanied by a simultaneous auto-critique of the discipline’s raison d’être. Indeed, this move to diversify touches on the philosophical underpinnings of what MIR is and should become as a field of research: What is music (ontology)? What are the nature and limits of knowledge concerning music (epistemology)? How do we obtain such knowledge (methodology)? And what about music and our own research endeavor do we consider “good” and “valuable” (axiology)?” ([Huang et al., 2023, p. 43](zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/KD4GMX8Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/AG5SKLUD?page=1&annotation=TYC8KI58))

- what is the ethical and culture turns of MIR

    - ought to scrutinize epistemological, ontological, methodological, and axiological assumptions

        - what are these assumptions

- what does it mean to diversify the discipline

- what is music (ontology)

- what are the nature and limits of knowledge in music (epistemology)

- how do we obtain knowledge (methodology)

- what is good and valuable about music


Music generated using AI constitutes a new kind of music ecosystem. Given that humans live increasingly fragmented realities, understanding the disjunctions that exist between different music worlds will help build an ethically responsible MIR community.

- MIR=Music Information research

- what does it mean to live a fragmented reality

- what disjunctions are there between different music worlds

- what is a music world

- what is an ethically responsible MIR community, what does it look like

- what is a music ecosystem


## Introduction

A culturally informed ethics of music AI. MIR as a field has yet to compete its cultural turn, in order to do so, the MIR community needs to diversify itself beyond “tokenistic gestures” by scrutinizing its own epsitemological, ontological, methodological, and axiological asuumptions.

- What is music (ontology)

- What is the nature and limits of knowledge concerning music (epistemology)

- How do we obtain this knowledge (methodology)

- What is good and valuable about music and [our own] research endeavors (axiology)


### An ethical turn in MIR

An ethics of AI technology needs to include concerns about human rights, well-being, data agency, effectiveness, transparency, accountability, awareness of competence and misuse. However, being written by members of affluent countries, most current proposals risks neglecting local knowledge and value systems.

While ISMIR is in a position to correct for ethical opportunities in advancing ethical principles surrounding AI technology, the individual members of the community have largely focused on the technology, ignoring the ethics.

#### Ethics, axiology, and technology

Axiology should be included in an ethics of AI. But here, axiology (meaning, characteristics, and classification of value, nature of evaluation, and the character of value judgments) refers to the research and the impact of the research on the stakeholders.

Some questions:

- who are the stakeholders

- what are the values of the research


Chang 2001, axiology is the philosophy of human life. The purpose of which is to provide a code for action. It does this by looking into the general nature, features, and types of value

Ethical Principles:

- human rights

- well-being

- data agency

- effectiveness

- transparency

- accountability

- awareness of misuse and competence


Axiological Principles

- meaning

- characteristics

- classification of value

- nature of evaluation

- character of value judgments

- value

    - nature

    - features

    - types


Axiological principles are also cultural (Chen 2018). This is an example of MIR’s engaging more ethnomusicology, the study of music as culture.

This represents the fact that MIR is increasingly making a cultural turn. As such, music is the study of a community’s core values, what gives their community meaning, what is characteristic about their community, how they classify value and what the nature of value is for them, and the character of their value judgments [Bunnin and Yu, 2004, 65].
